# Depression Diagnostic AI 💬🧠

Depression Diagnostic AI is a web-based chat assistant designed to support individuals experiencing symptoms of depression. Built with a warm, conversational interface, this AI helps users talk about their mental health, provides gentle emotional support, and can guide them toward further steps for care or reflection. The assistant responds with empathy, simulates a supportive conversation, and remembers previous inputs to provide contextual replies.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project aims to create a non-judgmental, safe space where users can express how they feel and receive thoughtful, compassionate replies powered by AI.
